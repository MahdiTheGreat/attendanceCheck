# attendanceCheck

Dr. Bahman is tired of paper-based and time-consuming class attendance and also wants to
People who entered the class 10 minutes later than the start time will be considered absent. The doctor knows that everyone
Students have their own ID and it requires you to create a system for attendance and absence like Figure below.

The program displays the ID on the LCD by entering the ID on the Keypad and if it is within the allowed time interval,
an LED will light up for 3 seconds and the servo motor will be in the opening state, otherwise the Buzzer will sound for 1 second and
It will sound and the servo motor will remain closed and the LCD will show the elapsed time of the class so that
the student will be aware of his delay!!! 
Also, at the end of the class, the names of the present and absent persons should be announced in the form of a list. 
Note that even if a person does not show his ID, he will be on the absentee list at the end of the class.
